            <p>As a professional with 6 years of training experience, Taje has come to the understanding that the greatest limiter is choice. He is a NASM certified Personal Trainer and specializes in balance and stability. Regardless of client goals, balance is the lowest common denominator, so his specialty is broad enough to facilitate a variety of physiological needs. He does this in order to remove as many obstacles as possible for his clients so that they get closer to that great limiter; choice. Once he helps his clients get there, they feel secure enough to make the decisions they need to regain, retain, or expand their health. A quote he lives by is:<br><br>"Those who ask for help -earnestly- deserve help."</p>
