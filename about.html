            <h1 class="teamMemberName">Stephen Goodman - CFO & COO</h1>
            <p style="margin: 0;">Stephen has had a long career in healthcare, working at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, focusing on optimizing operational workflows and rolling out new institutional initiatives.  His personal fitness journey started in 2009, when he first started weightlifting at his high school. It wasn't long before he was trying to get in there whenever he could to keep improving day after day.  This led him to pursue an undergraduate degree from SUNY Cortland in Kinesiology, the study of movement.  Nearing completion of his undergraduate program, Stephen found a new passion, business and finance. This led him to complete his MBA at Mercy College, concentrating in Finance and graduating Summa Cum Laude.  Stephen is a life-long resident of Westchester, and in his free time, enjoys exploring the beautiful nature the county has to offer, from hiking Bear Mountain, to the scenic Riverwalk in Tarrytown. Stephen is also involved with the Special Needs community in the area and is a head coach for the Sound Shore Stars Special Olympics Team based in Larchmont, NY.</p>
